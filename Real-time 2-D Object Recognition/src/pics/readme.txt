Results :

1. Command line output :
Execuation time taken by square operation using multiplication = 0.00113201
Execuation time taken by inbuilt pow function = 0.0165749
The relative computational cost = 14.642

Case where inbuilt pow function is better, when we are taking decimals as exponent
Execuation time taken by Decimal exponent without pow function = 0.00684404
Execuation time taken by Decimal exponent using pow function = 0.00425696

2. Interpretation :
Here, you can see that simple multiplication takes less time to compute square compared to C pow function.
But, in another case where we have to take exponent of decimal values then, pow function is better.
